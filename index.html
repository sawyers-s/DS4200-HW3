    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p> Hi, my name is Sophie and welcome to my website for Homework 3. On this site, I plan to focus on one of my main interests: 
        collecting vintage vinyl records. In particular, I want to share more information about my favorite band, The Beatles. I
        first started listening to The Beatles back in 2019 after seeing the film "Yesterday", named after the hit Beatles song of the 
        same name from their fifth studio album, "Help!". The film focused on what the world would be like if The Beatles had never existed, 
        but their songs did. Needless to say, after seeing the film and listening to the soundtrack repeatedly, I took an interest in 
        listening to the original Beatles recordings. Like so many others around the world, I was instantly hooked and haven't stopped 
        listening to the band since. On this website, I plan to share a few basic facts about The Beatles, some images of the band, 
        a breakdown of their original studio albums, and information about their August 1966 tour, which was their last tour ever as a band. 
        My hope is that, after viewing this website, you can learn a bit more about my interests and The Beatles, or even be encouraged to
        listen to The Beatles on your own time. I promise you won't regret it! </p>
