    <h2>Basic Facts</h2>

    <p> The Beatles consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. All four of the band members grew up in
        working-class Liverpool with little money. The Beatles' first studio album was "Please Please Me", released in 1963, and their
        last studio album was "Let It Be", released in 1970. The Beatles broke up that same year (1970). Most of the songs performed by
        The Beatles were written by Paul and John, though both George and Ringo have writing credits on some of the albums. Most of their 
        early studio albums included covers, with their third studio album, "A Hard Day's Night", released in 1964 being the first album to
        contain all Lennon-McCartney compositions. "A Hard Day's Night" was also turned into a film as was their fifth studio album, "Help!",
        released in 1965. "A Yellow Submarine", the band's eleventh studio album released in 1969, was also accompanied by a film, although 
        the film was a cartoon and only featured the band in the last couple minutes of the movie. Famously, The Beatles' final live performance
        was on the rooftop of the Apple Records building in downtown London on January 30th, 1969. Director Peter Jackson released a documentary
        titled "The Beatles: Get Back" in 2021 with recordings from the "Let It Be" studio sessions and never-before-seen footage from the live 
        rooftop concert, marking it as a nostalgic and enjoyable film for Beatles fans of all ages. Here are some images from the 1969 rooftop concert:
